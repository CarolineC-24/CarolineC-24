# _Dracula’s Guest_ TEI project

### Summary:

This week, I coded page one of _Dracula’s Guest_ using Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) in oXygen, that uses extensible Markup Language (XML). I first started in google docs with my portion of the assignment to mark up and dissect. I then pasted it into oXygen where the coding process began. 
Having no prior experience with coding, it was a daunting task. At first glance, the blank template on oXygen looked full of numbers, letters, and symbols. After a brief tutorial from my professor, and step by step directions from the TEI project assignment, it wasn’t so bad.

### Google Docs Markup:

My assignment portion of _Dracula’s Guest_ was the first page and first vocalics of the story. To preface, _Dracula’s Guest_ was first published in 1914 and follows the arduous journey of an Englishman’s trip to Count Dracula’s home despite warnings of unsafe travels. The part I marked up sets the scene for the departure from his hotel and his first warning to be back before nightfall.
I started by making comments to label each part of the text. This seemed monotonous at times, but I realized how important it was while coding in oXygen later. I labeled the page beginnings and ends, the title, new paragraphs, quotes, and spell checked the word “signalling” only to see that it had British origins so it could be left alone. Although a tedious process, it was useful to reference later on.

### OXygen and XML:

The class used different laptops which already had the coding program installed, so I had to begin the learning curve of using a Mac. I previously had used Macs in high school in graphic design classes that I learned Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator in so I wasn’t completely lost. I just had to look up how to screenshot the code when I was done. It was also cruical to wrap the text so that you can see everything you're working on which is similair to Github's line wrap mode feauture.

I started with the title, author, and editor tags making sure to fix the author's name. Then did the page beginning tag, the page number tag, then pasted my text from the google doc. From there I added the paragraph beginning and ending tags, and added quote tags when needed. Last, I added the note tag and erased the extra quotation marks after seeing them in the author tab.

This project in particular was a lot less challenging than I anticipated. Coding with oXygen seems a lot more feasible now that I have already done one project. I struggled with the detail-oriented parts as everything has to be perfect to display in the way you want it to appear. I enjoyed the red line feature that will let you know if you messed up so that you can go back to fix it. I also liked the author tab so you can see how it will actually appear; it reminded me of Github’s preview feature.
