# Course Review Blog

### Intro
When initially registering for Writing for Digital Humanities, I took the course to fulfill a writing requirement. Throughout the semester, I learned the skills used in this course can be very beneficial for my major and ultimately, my future career. During the registration period for next semester’s class, I decided I would minor in Digital Humanities. So, I discussed my requirements with Dr. Stover and adjusted my schedule accordingly to ensure eligibility for the minor.

### About Me blog
The feedback that I received from the initial About me GitHub blog was helpful in considering when writing is academic versus informal. The process was fun to see how all the keys and texts ended up displaying for the viewer. I liked how easy the topic was so we could really focus on figuring out the logistics of Github before doing anything too strenuous. 

### Review One blog
For the Review blog, I chose the dh project _Virtual St. Paul’s Cross Project: A Digital Re-Creation of John Donne’s Gunpowder Day Sermon, London 1622_. I found the process of critiquing more negative than positive. To me, it didn’t have much visual appeal as it was almost all black and white which made the connotation of the project less interesting. Although, when reviewing, I found some ideas that I would want to add to my future grant project. The digital humanist used links to YouTube videos and other hyperlinks that made it more interactive.

### TEI
Roueché’s _Why Do We Mark Up Texts?_ was insightful when coding with HTML for the TEI project of _Dracula’s Guest_. The story wasn’t particularly a fun read for me because it’s just not my favorite style. Nonetheless, my text to markup and code wasn’t too large so it was more easier than some of my peers. 

The TEI project was one of the more intimidating assignments as I had no prior experience with coding. But, I found the arduous process behind what goes into the visuals of the website, to be a very useful skill to have.

### Class activities and Readings
Class activities such as the eye-scanning reading were super helpful in considering the reader and the audience while writing. I enjoyed that all of the readings and class activities had a purpose for our course material and later assignments. I never felt like I was given busy work or rushed through assignments; the speed and frequency of the course were perfect.

Throughout the process of writing blogs for GitHub I had a hard time with the detail oriented coding. With just one wrong key, the entire link for a website a picture would be wrong, causing it not to display properly. When I finally ended up fixing the issues, I really enjoyed how customizable the blogs were. Being able to choose my own format and design was super fun, especially the visual aspect of it.

### Twitter
Using Twitter throughout the course was so much better than doing a discussion board. It was way more personable to be able to match a name with a face when interacting with each other's tweets. I liked how easily accessible it was to just tweet from my phone rather than having to login to Scholar for a formal discussion board. It was also a nice recap of that week’s class discussions or assignments reinstating the purpose for that week.

### Grant project
The most daunting part of the course this semester was the Grant Project. Although intimidating, it ended up being my favorite assignment. I loved how we were able to choose our own topic and for the most part, had free reign. I chose to propose an interactive timeline that goes through the history of D.A.R.E. (drug abuse resistance education) because I thought it would be intriguing as the war on drugs is still relevant to this day.

Receiving feedback throughout the process was great to make sure I was on the right track. I found the resume portion to be quite helpful when curating my own for summer internship applications. I’m currently in the interview process to hopefully secure a marketing internship thanks to the skills I’ve learned this course.

### Conclusion
The class started out as a requirement in order to obtain my degree but quickly ended up being the most interesting writing class I've ever taken. I loved how everything had a real-world example and how we could easily apply much of what we learned in our own future endevours. Since taking the course, I have learned that digital humanities is not bound by one definition, it can mean lots of different things which is also part of the fun.
