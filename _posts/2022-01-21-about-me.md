# **Caroline's About Me Blog**

Hi everyone my name is Caroline and this is my blog!

I'm a sophomore at CNU majoring in Communication studies and minoring in sociology and criminology. My pronouns are she/her. My interest in this course initially stems from fulfilling a requirement but more recently to gain knowledge about this subject and hopefully improve my skills. My involvements on campus include [cnuchaarg](https://www.instagram.com/cnu_inchaarg/) and the [cnu surf club](https://www.instagram.com/cnusurfclub/). My academic goals include maintaining a good gpa and not dropping out because of stress lol. My plan for school is to get an internship in my field, graduate in 2024 and have a career post grad. Due to my obsession with the show Criminal Minds and my interest in the field, I hope to work for the Bureau in intelligence communications, possibly in Quantico. If not, I'm sure I'll figure something out. Also, in light of recent weather it might be important to tell you all I hate winter and snow so eventually I would like to move south where it never snows. :)

# Background:
![Family](https://carolinec-24.github.io/CarolineC-24/images/fam.jpg)
The picture above is my family and I at my cousin's wedding this past summer in Charlottesville, VA. I grew up in Manassas Virginia and graduated Forest Park High School in 2020. In high school I played Field Hockey for two years and Lacrosse four years. I think this is where my addiction to working out stems from; that or playing sports ever since I was three. In high school I worked at a residential gym for two years along with babysitting. This past summer I was a waitress at a local restaurant and let me tell you, I had no idea what I was getting myself into. Obviously covid was a thing, we were understaffed, and occasionally I had to deal with very bitter people that made my job hell. Otherwise, the tips were great! My other hobbies include painting and going out with my friends.

Another important thing to note about me is that I absolutely love the beach. Something about it is so calming and comfortable; I have only good memories there. In reference to the picture above, I am also super big on mindfulness and inner peace. I am a big advocate that mental and physical health come before school but this wasn't always the case. Last year was my first year on campus and it was rough to say the least. I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life and that uncertainty haunted me. Eventually I reached out and ended up on the right track for school and for life. _Yay me!_ I hope you all enjoyed reading this and I'm super excited for the rest of this semester.
