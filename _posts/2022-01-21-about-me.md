#**Caroline's About Me Blog**

Hi everyone my name is Caroline and this is my blog!
![Caroline standing](https://github.com/CarolineC-24/CarolineC-24/blob/main/images/me.jpg)

I'm a sophmore at CNU majoring in Communication studies and minoring in soociology and criminology. My pronouns are she/her. My interest in this course initially stems from fufilling a requirement but more recently to gain knowledge about this subject and hopefully improve my skills. My involvements on campus include [cnuchaarg](https://www.instagram.com/cnu_inchaarg/) and the [cnu surf club](https://www.instagram.com/cnusurfclub/). My plan for school is to graduate in 2024 and have a career. Due to my obsession with the show Criminal Minds and my interest in the field, I hope to work for the Bureau in intelligence communications, possibly in Quantico. If not, I'm sure I'll figure something out. In light of recent weather it might be important to tell you all I hate winter and snow so eventually I would like to move south.

#Background:
![Family](https://github.com/CarolineC-24/CarolineC-24/blob/main/images/fam.jpg)
The picture above is my family and I at my cousin's wedding this past summer in Charlottsville, VA. I grew up in Manassas Virginia and graduated Forest Park High School in 2020. In highschool I played Field Hockey for two years and Lacrosse for four years. I think this is where my addiction to working out stems from; that or playing sports since I was three. My other hobbies include painting and going out with my friends.
