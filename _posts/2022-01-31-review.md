#### **Summary:**
The site is a digital recreation of a sermon that took place in London 1622. Although very difficult to track exact details of the event, the digital humanist provides great detail of the event with visual images including blueprints of the buildings surrounding the sermon. 

It focuses on the logistics behind how hundreds of people would be able to hear one human voice outdoors back in the 1600s without the technology that we have today. John Donne’s purpose for his sermon was a Sunday Easter service.

#### **Accessibility and Overview:**
The site organizes information by seven dropdown bars titled _Overview, Churchyard, Acoustics, Preacher, Occasion, Sermon,_ and _Support_ each with various subheadings. The subheadings often have visual models with descriptions underneath. The site offers many links to direct the viewer to different points around the site. 

In a world centered around convenience, it is important to note the mobile version of this site does not transfer well. As the picture below shows, the format is completely different from what a computer user would see; there is room for improvement.

#### **Rundown of each dropdown:**
Overview: The overview dropdown is a great place to start on a site like this with so much information that can be overwhelming at times. It is very direct by going over the main purpose of this site and how it came to be. The first title in the dropdown These are the houres, although simple, are telling of how influential this event was.

**Churchyard**: Contains visual models of the setting during the sermon. These details include where people would listen in relation to the preacher and distractions relevant to the outdoor setting.

**Acoustics**: This dropdown, surprisingly, was the least appealing to me out of any of them considering there is no reading or script of what was even said during the sermon. The acoustics were of horses, birds, and dogs which doesn’t add much to the historical significance of the event.

**Preacher**: This slide gives background on John Donne including his preaching style, his credibility and his other works. Finally we get some auditory “moments” of how the sermon was organized and spoken. I am confused as to why this wouldn’t be in the sermon dropdown as it directly fits there.

**Occasion**: The environment, the weather, and the size of the crowd play a huge role in the sermon. It directly affects the historical significance behind this event. If there was little to no crowd, likely there would not be a whole site about it now.

**Sermon**: The entirety of the script for the sermon is displayed along with some pretense following up to the start of John Donne first addressing the audience. Additionally, there are links to two youtube videos where you can audibly listen to the sermon either from the sermon house or in the courtyard. This attention to detail is quite impressive and definitely something I would have just looked over.

**Support**: This section is dedicated to giving credit where credit is due. Everything from the advisory committee to North Carolina State University and each of their respective departments. It was beautiful how extensive this part was in making sure everyone involved was named.
